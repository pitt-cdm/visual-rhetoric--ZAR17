For my visual rhetoric image which I’ve chosen to name, “I’mmortal” I wanted the audience to see a beautiful but yet still creepy image. The feeling was necessary to complete the message I was trying to portray, which is that growing up and getting older can be a scary thing. The hot air balloon being the moon was chosen because a hot air balloon is a vessel that predominantly travels up and down, similar to the highs and lows of life. The moon replacing the balloon is because as a child you have very high aspirations and children are often times promised the world, so its purpose is a sort of message that children who are growing up are often times promised the world and that the sky is the limit. The hot air balloon was purposefully placed in the corner of the picture to show that they’re trying to avoid the ominously bright star/supernova. Though the exploding star is dangerous and could ultimately seriously injure the balloon and its passengers, you can see by zooming in that the passengers are actually observing it happen. It’s supposed to show that humans can find beauty in all things. The planet that’s in the background behind the moon was strategically placed there because of the lack of room there was to work with when I had the idea to put it in, as well as the fact that it appears the balloon is on track to arrive there, as it’s their destination. The light shining on the planet is supposed to be coming from the supernova, I like to imagine that it means good things can come from bad situations, and we need them to grow. The planet is the “dream” previously referred to, or really the end destination as to what a person expects and hopes for in life. As for the text, the name that appears on the balloon is “S.S Requiem” which out of context probably makes no sense. Upon closer inspection you can see that on the basket there are the words “For a Dream”, which altogether is an alliteration to the movie “Requiem for a Dream” which Wikipedia describes the storyline to be, “human beings longing to connect, to love and feel loved, the film is a parable of happiness gloriously found and tragically lost.” Which is essentially one of the morals of the artwork. To put it simply, what I hope people see when they look at what I’ve created is that experience has taught me that life is not clear cut; there is no one right road. We’re promised bigger and better from a young age so that we have high aspirations for ourselves. Though the road we travel is our own, there’s multiple passengers to show that we’re never truly alone and there are people who will be there for us even when we may feel most alone. There will be bumps in the road (the clear break in space with the two layers meet), but the good times will make it all worth it. 
 The moon was made by using the “Scissor-cut” tool which I used to create the shape by laying the moon underneath the picture of the balloon and drawing my selection around the edge of the balloon. The balloon itself was ultimately deleted. I attempted to have juxtaposition by using the dark void of space accompanied by some of the blurry stars in the foreground of the picture as well as the insanely bright supernova. I unsuccessfully used a drop shadow on the text to make it appear less out of place, the gray of the moon blended with the shadow pretty well. I used the fuzzy select tool quite a bit for doing the cutting out of the balloon which took forever. I downloaded some cool new brushes that make whirlwind type of shapes, which I used to make the blackhole that’s no longer featured in the picture. I left the layer there though because I couldn’t bring myself to delete it. Many of the pictures I used such as a picture of the galaxy, the starry background, the lights, the planets, are all “Dodged” instead of “normal” in their layer attributes. Dodging a layer gives it an opacity or something, but it makes it so the layer is visible through other layers. I also used the rotate tool when I put the second starry background layer in as well as the perspective tool when I wrote the “For a Dream” on the basket. I also used the paintbrush to paint a brown layer over the basket to make the text more eligible. I was able to get that color of brown by CTRL + Mouse 1 clicking on the brown of the basket.
